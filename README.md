# Test_repo
"Reporitory to be practicing" 

This repository has a terraform and ansible infrastructure that:
Terraform: We can deploy 3 AWS virtual machines with 10Gb HD size, docker images, security group, route table, ssh key, vpc and subnet, and was given Workers and Master names to the VMs.
Ansible: We used the AWS plugin to connect ansible with the hosts. Also we separated the VMs into two workers and one master.  The workers Vms we installed nginx servers, transfer files, on the VMs we created 2 users and assigned permissions. The other Vm we installed was the apache2 web server.
